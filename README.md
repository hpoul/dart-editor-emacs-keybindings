dart-editor-emacs-keybindings
=============================

Just a few keybindings to prevent emacs users from going crazy while using dart editor.

Feel free to use and modify it, or tell me of better keybinding templates.

To use it simply go into Dart Editor Preferences -> Key Bindings -> Import from File. Hopefully it stays compatible for a few versions..
